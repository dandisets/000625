description: DfOverF and fluorescence dataset from a hippocampal CA1 interneuron population.
  The goal was to label the different interneuron subtypes which were molecularly
  identified. Data was collected by Tristan Geiller at the Losonczy Lab using two
  photon calcium imaging and head-fixed mice running on a voluntary treadmill.
